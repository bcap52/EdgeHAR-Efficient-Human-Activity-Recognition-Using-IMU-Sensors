# EdgeHAR-Efficient-Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-IMU-Sensors
This project addresses the challenge of deploying Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on edge devices with limited processing power. We processed 50Hz accelerometer data from a thigh-mounted IMU to classify distinct activities, including static postures (Sitting, Standing) and dynamic movements (Running, Cycling, Stairs).
