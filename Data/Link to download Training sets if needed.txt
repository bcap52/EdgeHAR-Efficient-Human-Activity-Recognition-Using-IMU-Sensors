You can download all the datasets from this link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wDTIjdsdI3b8swcYLC1aKmRJAtfkY0Kp?usp=sharing) and if you want to process data on your own machine you need to place all the required csv files inside this folder otherwise the main_script will just use the already preprocessed and feature engineered dataset(processedData.mat)
